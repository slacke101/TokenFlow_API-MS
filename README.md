 # TokenFlow: Microsoft Office 365 Add-On #

**Tagline:** Streamline approvals and workflow tracking across Teams, SharePoint, Planner, and Outlook using industry-agnostic Work Tokens.

---

## Overview

**TokenFlow** is a Microsoft 365–native workflow tracking system that introduces **Work Tokens** — abstract units of work representing tasks, approvals, or requests. Designed to **complement Microsoft tools**, not replace them, TokenFlow provides visibility, accountability, and safe workflow intelligence for organizations across HR, medical administration, universities, finance, and more.

> Tokens track **work progress**, not employee performance, ensuring ethical and transparent workflow management.
